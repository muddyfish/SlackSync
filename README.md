# SlackSync

## Written for Discord's 2019 Hack week


### [Download the final build](https://github.com/muddyfish/SlackSync/releases)


SlackSync allows you to sync messages between Slack and Discord between servers and channels.

To start the bot, download and double click the exe. It'll start up a web browser and guide you through the steps you'll need to take.

Prerequisites
 - A Discord account
 - A Slack account

Currently, SlackSync supports unlimited Discord servers, but only a single Slack workspace.

The bot supports creating connections bidirectionally or one way only.

There is no authentication for the web pages, so running on an intranet is advised rather than the open internet.
